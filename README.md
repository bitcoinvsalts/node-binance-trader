# Why Node-Binance-Trader? 📖

My name is Herve Fulchiron, I’m a passionate full stack JS engineer, and I also trade cryptocurrencies on a weekly basis. I mostly use <a href="https://jsapp.me" target="_blank">Binance</a> for my altcoins trading. The high volatility of the crypto market makes it an emotional rollercoster that requires high awareness and constant attention. This demands a lot of time to monitor always more trading pairs and more data to process. Like most of the people I used to trade manually via the Binance website. I was slow to execute and beating the market gets more difficult every days.  It was time to automate my strategy testing and my trading operations. I tried <a href="https://github.com/askmike/gekko" target="_blank">Gekko</a>, it's a nice tool specially for back testing but I wanted something much simplier, dedicated to Binance, and to be able to test my strategies as fast and as easy as possible live on the crypto market. So I wrote this one simple but efficient node.js script to:

* monitor in real time all the BTC trading pairs on Binance
* apply one or multiple strategies to those markets 
* record live performances of those strategies over time
* auto trade the most successful strategies
